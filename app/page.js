          In my recent project, I utilized <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> to create a responsive and visually appealing web application. Next.js provided a robust framework for server-side rendering and static site generation, enabling me to optimize performance and improve SEO. Tailwind CSS complemented this by offering a utility-first approach to styling, allowing for rapid design iteration without leaving the HTML. However, I encountered several challenges when deploying the Next.js application to GitHub Pages. One significant issue was that GitHub Pages primarily serves static files, while Next.js applications typically require a Node.js server to handle dynamic routing and API requests. This discrepancy necessitated the use of a custom build process to export the application as static files. Additionally, I faced difficulties with configuring the paths correctly in the `next.config.js` file, as the default routing expected a different structure than what GitHub Pages supports. Despite these hurdles, the experience enhanced my understanding of deployment processes and the intricacies of working with modern web frameworks, ultimately leading to a successful deployment of the application.
